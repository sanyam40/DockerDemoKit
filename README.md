# Docker Demo Kit üê¨
This repository provides a collection of Dockerized projects for demonstration purposes.

# What is Docker?
Docker is a containerization technology that enables developers to package applications and their dependencies into self-contained units called containers. Containers are isolated environments that include everything needed to run an application, such as code, runtime, system tools, libraries, and settings. They provide consistency and reproducibility, ensuring that applications run consistently across different environments. It can streamline application development and deployment processes.

# Description

- Spring Boot Project: A sample Spring Boot application that demonstrates containerizing a Java-based web application using Docker.
- Basic Java Project: A minimalistic Java project demonstrating how to containerize a standalone Java application with Docker.
- React App: An example React application that illustrates containerizing a frontend web application using Docker.
- Spring Boot + MySQL with Docker Compose: A Docker Compose configuration that sets up a Spring Boot application with an integrated MySQL database.

Each project includes a Dockerfile, which defines the necessary steps to build a Docker image for that specific project. With Docker, you can easily build, run, and deploy these projects in isolated containers, ensuring consistency across different environments and simplifying the development workflow.
